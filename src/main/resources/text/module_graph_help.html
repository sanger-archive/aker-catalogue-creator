<p><b>Module graph</b></p>
<br/>
<p>The <i>To add</i> combo shows all modules listed in the catalogue.</p>
<p>To add a module to the graph, select it from the combo, and then double-click in the graph at the position
you want to add the module.</p>
<p>The same module cannot be added to the graph twice.</p>
<p>Modules must be positioned below the START node and above the END node.</p>
<br/>
<p>To add a path, right-click on a module and drag to another module.</p>
<p>The end-node of a path must be positioned lower in the graph than the start-node.</p>
<p>Shift-click on a path to toggle it as a default path. Default paths are shown in green.</p>
<br/>
<p>Click on a module or a path to select it.</p>
<p>Press DELETE to delete a selected path or module.</p>
<p>Drag a module to reposition it. Modules must remain between the START and END nodes. The start-node
of paths must stay above the end-node.</p>
<br/>
<p>The <i>Validate</i> option in the <i>Edit</i> menu will check your graphs are laid out correctly.</p>
<br/>
<p>The default layout for a module graph is generated based on the paths between modules when you
load a catalogue file. Use <i>Auto layout</i> to recalculate the default layout for your
current graph.</p>
<br/>
<p>Use <i>Resize graph window</i> to adjust the graph bounds to
accommodate the current positions of the modules.</p>
